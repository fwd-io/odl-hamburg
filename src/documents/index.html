        <h2>Open Device Labs</h2>
        <p>
            The range of Smartphones and Tablets increases every day, and often it is not easy for web developers to test on all relevant devices. Open Device Labs provide a solution to this problem: Donated and rented devices are collected and made available, for free and for everyone.
